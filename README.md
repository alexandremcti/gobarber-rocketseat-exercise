# gobarber-rocketseat-exercise
This is a project that I did from Rocketseat course. I practiced TDD, SOLID, Separation of Responsabilty and DRY concepts as well as Integration with relational DB(Postgres), non-relational DB(Mongo and Redis), containers, handlebars and sending e-mail templates with nodemailer. It also was created using clean architecture.
